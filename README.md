> Small interference RNA (siRNA), selectively accumulates and acts in RNA interference (RNAi). However, the mechanism(s) for this selectivity (or RNAi effectivity) remains unclear, although Dicer-like proteins, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and the components that interact with them have long been the focus of studies to elucidate RNAi processes. In a novel approach, we developed a progressive deep learning (DL) framework integrating Transformer and convolutional neural networks to predict the sequences of selectively accumulated siRNAs in various land plant species. These approaches achieved high accuracy prediction of selectively accumulated 21-nt siRNAs, and identified their key signals, which are positionally and linguistically flexible sequences surrounding the target siRNA. We experimentally validated the contribution of these flexible key sequences to siRNA accumulation selectivity using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Furthermore, RNA-centric RNA-protein interactome analysis identified novel KH-domain RNA-binding proteins that directly recognize the key signal sequences, and this recognition is required for the selective accumulation of siRNAs. These insights provide a novel framework for investigating RNAi mechanisms in plants.
